<br>
<br>
<p>There are 2 ways to set a terrace garden, either you can cover the entire surface with soil to convert it to a lawn or you can put plant pots and grow plants in them. 
As terraces have some space constraints as compared to a normal garden, planning the space usage accordingly is necessary.  
Look for the places which are shaded and  and also for areas which receive sunlight for the maximum time of the day. 
If you are planning for any sitting area on the terrace, determine its place. 
During summer, plants need to be protected from direct sunlight, for this you can make a shade. Select the place for this.</p>
<br>

 
<li><b>SELECT THE PLANTS</b></li>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>This is a very interesting step to make a terrace garden. There are a variety of plants, but fiber rooted plants are recommended over deep rooted plants which require more depth of soil and hence more weight.
 Select plants according to the sun shade on your roof. Weak plants which require less sunlight must be placed in the shaded areas.
  While, plants which require a hefty amount of sunlight must be placed in non shaded areas. You can buy seeds of the required plants.</p>
<br>


<li><b>WATER PROOFING</b></li>
<br>
